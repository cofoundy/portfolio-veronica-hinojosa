# Design Proposal — Veronica Hinojosa-Stang

## Identidad
Veronica is the most trusted baby nurse in Los Angeles — 26 years, 1,000+ families, 91+ five-star Yelp reviews. She's not selling a service; she's offering her presence. A Peruvian educator who became LA's go-to newborn care specialist, she shows up for EVERYONE: preemies, twins, NICU babies, LGBT families, adoption, surrogacy, Medi-Cal families. She's still getting certified at 50+ (NICU Doula 2026, Trauma Informed 2026). Press-featured. Award-winning. Her tagline IS her: "Nest and rest, while she takes care of the rest."

## Audiencia
Exhausted, overwhelmed new parents in LA googling "baby nurse near me" at 2am. They need to feel SAFE within 3 seconds. Secondary: families through Carrot Benefits, surrogacy agencies, LGBT family networks. They need credibility + warmth.

## Secciones Propuestas (en orden)

1. **Hero — "Your Doula, Veronica"**
   Full viewport. Circular photo with warm glow. Name large. Brand label "Baby Nurse & Doula Services". Tagline italic. Single warm CTA. Stats float below as glass cards. NO social icons cluttering — move to footer.

2. **"A Letter from Veronica"** (replaces generic About)
   Her EXACT text, styled as a personal letter. Warm background. Ends with her actual signoff: "With warmth and dedication, Your Doula, Veronica". This is HER voice, not a bio. Mission statement as a pullquote card below.

3. **"Why Families Trust Veronica"** (replaces generic trust)
   THREE proof pillars side by side:
   - Yelp card (91+ reviews, 5 stars, link)
   - Award badge ("Most Awesome Doula Business 2013")
   - Press card ("Featured in La Opinión & Voyage LA")
   This is the "social proof wall" — the section that converts visitors into callers.

4. **"In the News"** (she EXPLICITLY asked for this)
   Two article cards — Voyage LA (with link) and La Opinión.
   Styled as newspaper clippings or editorial cards.

5. **"How Veronica Helps"** (replaces generic Services grid)
   NOT 6 identical cards. Instead: a flowing narrative with icons.
   Three main pillars with brief descriptions:
   - 🌙 Night Nurse & Newborn Care (the core)
   - 🤱 Birth & Postpartum Doula (the journey)
   - ✈️ Traveling & International Doula (the reach)
   Under each, 2-3 bullet specialties. Feels like a conversation, not a catalog.

6. **"42+ Certifications"** (replaces generic education grid)
   NOT a grid of cards. Instead: a scrolling ribbon/marquee of certification names,
   with the top 6 highlighted as featured badges. Shows breadth without boredom.
   Highlighted: NICU Doula 2026, Trauma Informed 2026, Kangaroula, Safe Sleep,
   Birth Doula DONA, Bachelor's in Education.

7. **Warm CTA + Footer**
   "Ready to start your journey?" with email + phone.
   Social links here (LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, Yelp).
   Her closing: "You deserve the best."

## Secciones que NO incluir
- Generic "Services" cards with skill pills → replaced by narrative "How Veronica Helps"
- Generic "Experience" timeline → her experience IS the whole site; doesn't need a separate section
- Generic "Skills" pills section → replaced by certification ribbon
- CTA shimmer bars → too template-y

## Metáfora Visual
A warm nursery at golden hour. Soft light, rounded shapes, breathing space. The feeling when someone competent walks in and says "I've got this, go rest." Turquoise (her request) as calm authority, warm peach as nurturing warmth. Not clinical. Not corporate. Intimate and professional.

## Visual Language
- **Colors**: Deep teal `#0D7377` (calm authority) + Warm coral `#E8936A` (maternal warmth) + Cream `#FDF8F4` (nursery warmth) + Soft gray `#6B7280`
- **Fonts**: Cormorant Garamond (elegant headings — warmer than Libre Baskerville) + Source Sans 3 (clean body)
- **Unique effect**: Certification marquee ribbon + warm gradient "letter" background for About
- **Shapes**: All rounded (rounded-2xl, rounded-full). No sharp corners. Babies don't have sharp corners.
