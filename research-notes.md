- Voyage LA article URL not found in search

## Oportunidad Upsell
- **MUY ALTO**: Has existing business with multiple services, pricing, team members
- Lost her domain babynurseanddoulaservices.com - needs landing page
- Training services in Spanish - could be separate offering
- 91+ Yelp reviews = massive social proof for conversion
- International doula services = premium positioning
